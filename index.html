While some software developers may focus on a specific program or app, others create giant networks or underlying systems that help trigger and power other programs. This is why there are two main classifications of developers: applications software developers and systems software developers.</td>

Along with their teams, they coordinate accounting and produce financial reports, cash-flow statements and profit projections. To comply with various laws and regulations, they must pay attention to detail.

These all-important employees deliver short- and long-term visions for the company's technology needs and goals. Even though most IT managers have the technical chops to execute the various jobs of the workers they supervise, they are more likely to be caught in a meeting room than a server room.</td>

And although these professionals have many responsibilities, their first task is to understand their client's business, whether it's an organization in Silicon Valley or a firm on Wall Street. And they'll specifically want to learn how the organization uses technology. Analysts will then research the best technologies to help the organization's overall computer system – the hardware, the software and the networks – run more efficiently and effectively.</td>

                <td>Financial advisors meet with clients and counsel them on their finances. This could mean sitting down and creating budgets, firming up retirement plans or giving advice about investing. Financial advisors can also invest a client's funds and meet with them regularly to discuss their investments. Some are also licensed to sell insurance. Many times, financial advisors help plan a safe, comfortable future for their clients, but they're also called upon when the unexpected occurs – perhaps an aging parent suddenly requires a live-in nurse, a couple plans on divorcing or a child needs to transfer to an expensive private school. Financial advisors may step in and make sense of these fiscal troubles and create a plan for moving forward.</td>

Every business needs them, large or small, regardless of industry. Their job includes hiring people, negotiating contracts, addressing budget matters, understanding general business operations and guiding work teams for projects.
